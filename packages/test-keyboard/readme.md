# test-keyboard

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/test-keyboard.svg?&logo=npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/test-keyboard)

A test keyboard for dispatching events to the dom which mimics keyboard actions from the user.

## The problem

You want to write tests for code that makes heavy usage of the keyboard and you're finding it hard to compose these keyboard events together.

## This solution

`test-keyboard` is an elegant way of composing keyboard events together as if a user was typing.

It is primarily designed for dom-test environments but could be extracted out into something that can be used in your front-end code.

## Installation

```bash
yarn add test-keyboard # yarn
pnpm add test-keyboard # pnpm
npm install test-keyboard # npm
```

## `Keyboard.create` - `(params: KeyboardConstructorParameter) => Keyboard`

```ts
import { Keyboard } from 'test-keyboard';

const target = document.querySelector('#editor');
Keyboard.create({
  target,
})
  .start() // Allows events to be dispatched
  .mod({ text: 'Ctrl-Shift-Enter' })
  .end(); // Dispatches al the events.
```

### `KeyboardConstructorParameter`

| **Property** | **Type** | **Default** | **Description** |
| --- | :-: | :-: | --- |
| `target` | `Element` | **REQUIRED** | The target of our events. |
| `defaultOptions` | `KeyboardEventInit` | `{}` | The target of our events. |
| `isMac` | `boolean` | `false` | Whether to simulate a mac. |
| `batch` | `boolean` | `false` | Whether to wait until end is called before running all accumulated actions. |
| `onEventDispatch` | `(event: KeyboardEvent) => void` | `() => {}` | Called whenever an event is dispatched with the keyboard event as a parameter. |
