## Installation

```bash
# yarn
yarn add @remirror/extension-gap-cursor @remirror/pm

# pnpm
pnpm add @remirror/extension-gap-cursor @remirror/pm

# npm
npm install @remirror/extension-gap-cursor @remirror/pm
```

This is included by default when you install the recommended `remirror` package. All exports are also available via the entry-point, `remirror/extensions`.

## Usage

The following code creates an instance of this extension.

```ts
import { GapCursorExtension } from 'remirror/extensions';

const extension = new GapCursorExtension();
```

When enabled, this will capture clicks near and arrow-key-motion past places that don't have a normally selectable position nearby, and create a gap cursor selection for them. The cursor is drawn as an element with class `ProseMirror-gapcursor`.

Make sure to import the styles as shown below.

```ts
import 'remirror/styles/gap-cursor.css';
```
