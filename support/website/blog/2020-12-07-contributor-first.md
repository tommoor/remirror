It's come to my attention that there's been a big slowdown in the progress of the mirror. Over the last few months the pace of development has really slowed and I'm aware that this was not the plan when I first started working on the project. One thing I mindful of is the fact that the mirror needs work to be done on it.

So I've been working on the mirror for approximately a year now and around six months ago interest in the project spiked.

Signed up for the sponsorship program on get up and do you wanna months of June July and August my sponsorship went from quite a low amount to just under $3000 per month which was well and deserved. A shout out to the black lives matter movement and I think that did pushing interest into the project but the mirror was nowhere near the quality for that kind of investment. What happened in the subsequent months was

Okay I wanna see how long he can type for before it runs out of space

. I find it typing like this is very difficult. This is amazing. How long does this go for. Does it run out after a few seconds. These are questions I'm asking myself while writing a blog. Okay this is useful for learning how to structure my thoughts and speak in a way that can be written down immediately so thoughtful

Contributor first approach to `remirror`.

- Add contributors to sponsorship list for contributions over the course of 2020.
- Better commenting.
- Better tools.
  - Builds are faster and more reliable with tools like `esbuild`.
  - Builds can target specific project
- Ability to release with confidence
  - Releases are tested against actual npm installations.
  - PR's contain releases and the ability to install releases for the project (stored in a URL).

Notes

Story - of.

Some of the best things have been built by others.

- Playground Benjie (in fact, I'm doubling down on the playground)
- Annotations plugin built by Ron

Moving away from a sponsorship model.
